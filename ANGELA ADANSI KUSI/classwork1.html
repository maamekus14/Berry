	<h1>My Profile</h1>
	<p class="angela">Hi, my name is Angela Adansi Kusi. I was born on the 14th of January 1992 in a small town called Nsuta in the Ashanti region of Ghana. I had my secondary education at Ofori Panin Senior High school and continued to Accra Polytechnic now Accra Technical University. From there, i continued to GIMPA where i pursued a BSc in Business Administration and graduated successfully. I am an interesting fun loving lady with a great sense of humor. Although at first i come of as a very shy individualistic person, once i get to know a person and get comfortable with the environment, i am great. I believe that friendships is one of the most important values in human life. It's hard for me to make friends but once i make them, i'm great and i'm all different. In this life, we are all bound to put on a show sometime and so not show who we really are or what we really feel but some people do this constantly and those types of people i cannot stand. The goal i'm currently striving to achieve is to make this place a better place to live in starting the changes with myself. Sure, i've had some bad experiences before and that is what made Angela who she is today; grateful, full of love with a desire to study well because it will make me a successful person in the future and have a high high quality of life. I believe this is manifesting itself day by day thereby increasing my responsibilities for what i do and where i go. To conclude, i am happy about being who i am. It is true that i am not perfect like anybody else. However, i am a student of my mistakes and i'll do everything to make my family proud of me. That's why i'm going towards achieving my goals with perseverance and a smile on my face.<br><img class="maame" src="IMAGES/angela.jpg" alt="one person standing"></p>
